## Learning Rust <a name="learning"></a>
Start with [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), then [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/). Consider building a small personal project while you're learning the language -- this preferrably should not be something *cutting edge*. It is better to start with something small and iteratively add to it instead of setting lofty, unrealistic goals from the start.

* [Steve Donovan's Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html)
* [Tutorials (may be outdated)](http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/html/toc.html)
* [Recent Stanford OS Class](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/syllabus/#schedule)

For my first project, I'll be working with the [Rust Lang Nursery Markdown Book Generator](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).

## WASM <a name="wasm"></a>
* [Parity WASM resources](https://wiki.parity.io/WebAssembly-Links.html)
* [The Rusty Web](https://davidmcneil.github.io/the-rusty-web/)

## BLOCKCHAIN <a name="blockchain"></a>
> a good exercise is to build a simple multisig in Rust (consider basically transalting Stefan George's Gnosis Multisig with the Parity Wallet)
* [Parity Substrate](https://wiki.parity.io/Parity-Substrate)
* ZCash
* Grin/MimbleWimble

## DEEP LEARNING <a name="deeplearning"></a>
* [Juice](https://github.com/spearow/juice)

## Random <a name="random"></a>
* Use Rust-lang-nursery to become proficient at binding C++ libraries for Rust applications
* Focus on graph-based databases and graph algorithms
* [24 days or Rust](http://zsiciarz.github.io/24daysofrust/index.html)
