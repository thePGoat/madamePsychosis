# Madame Psychosis
This is a repo that will track my development over time. **I am an anonymous Rust dev**. You can check out the list of open source [Projects](projects/schedule.md) that I'm working on...reach out at thePGoat <at> protonmail.ch to get involved in my work.
  
[Excerpts From: Rust Types for Solid Safety](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/notes/lec2/paper.pdf)
> "Ideally, we would like a practical language that gives programmers direct control over memory and aliasing while also offering race and memory safety guarantees".

> Rusty Types maintain several key invariants that lead to memory and race safety. To start, every storage location is guaranteed to have either: (a) 1 mutable reference and 0 immutable references to it, or (b) 0 mutable references and n immutable references to it. This invariant directly prevents races as it prohibits concurrent writers and readers to a single memory location. By itself, however, this invariant is not enough to guarantee memory safety, especially in the presence of moveable objects. For instance, since a given variable becomes unusable after its object has been moved, the storage locations associated with that variable may be reused or freed. As a result, any references to that variable will be dangling and invalid after a move. To prevent this, Rusty Types also ensure that each object has a unique binding, the owner, and that references to an object or its contents are created transitively through its owner. The type system guarantees that an objectâ€™s owner does not change (the result of a move) while references areoutstanding. Conversely, the type system allows change ofownership when there are no outstanding references.Together, these invariants ensure that no references areleft dangling or pointing to invalid memory.
